## Setup

To play with the code I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it locally. Instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

Both Python 2 & 3 should work to execute the code. 

If you are running forest_path.py or line_of_trees.py, make sure you also have base_tree.py saved in the same folder locally.
